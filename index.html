                 <p>This is Harumi, a high school student whose only wish was to read any book he would like to.

                <p>However, due to some abnormal circumstances, he is living in a dog's body after getting shot.  Although he still sustains the same passion for literature it is tough for to him flip through pages by paws.</p>
                <p>Since this is the case, we are here to offer him a new and accessible option to keep doing what he loves most: a Kindle!</p>

                <p>First, because the Kindles do not weigh more than 200g, and the second reason is that its screen is commanded by just touching. It's perfect for your paws!</p>

            <p>Getting started with turning on your device, it's quite simples since it has only one power button. So you just have to press this button.</p>
            <p>Of course, the device must be charged before, and you can do that by connecting the USB cable where the side image shows.</p>

                <p>Bellow the toolbar, on the Home Screen, there are three sections you could choose to start your reading: 1) Recently Accessed Items; 2) My Reading Lists; and 3) Recommended for You. Clicking on one of these three sections you can choose a book to start your reading.</p>

                <p>When you get to the reading screen the toolbar will disappear and you should, as it shows on the side image, tap on that area, and the toolbar will be shown again.</p>
                <p>To go to the next or the previous page you should tap the areas as indicated in the side image. Or you can just slide the pages with your finger (or with your paws): from the left to the right side, you go to the previous page; and from the right to the left, you go to the next page.</p>
                <p>To change the font size you must press the screen using the two paws and make an opening movement to get it bigger and a closing movement to make it smaller.</p>
