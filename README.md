# kindle-tutorial

This project was created for an exercise of an English Class at Instituto Federal Sul-rio-grandense. It is composed only of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The images are from an anime titled "Inu to Hasami wa Tsukayo" and from the 5h edition of "Kindle user's guide". All the images don't belong to us.
